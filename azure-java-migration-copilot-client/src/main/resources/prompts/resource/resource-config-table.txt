You should display converted JSON in grid-style table format separate by category except detection reasons:
| Property | Current value | Description | Source of detection
You must indicate whether a category detected from report.
If a property doesn't have current value, use default value instead
Map source of detection based on property
Map description from {{schema}}
Map detection reason based on category name

Remind user to enter 'done' when finished and only answer question relates to the table.
