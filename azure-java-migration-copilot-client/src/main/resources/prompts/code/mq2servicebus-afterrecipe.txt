You need to rewrite the code using Azure Service Bus with Spring Messaging instead of RabbitMQ with Spring AMQP., change the code following below steps:
1.0 Keep the existing package statement.
1.1 Keep existing import statements, only add the needed import statement but don't change the existing import statement.
1.2 if class com.azure.spring.messaging.servicebus.core.ServiceBusTemplate is used in the java code, fix syntax error referring to below code snippet:
```java
    public void sendMessage(String message) {
        serviceBusTemplate.send(QUEUE_NAME, MessageBuilder.withPayload(message).build());
        // need to import org.springframework.messaging.support.MessageBuilder
    }
}
```
1.3 Be sure to add the @EnableAzureMessaging annotation(com.azure.spring.messaging.implementation.annotation.EnableAzureMessaging) on class, which triggers the discovery of methods annotated with @ServiceBusListener, creating the message listener container under the covers.

2.1 In rabbit MQ, there is concept of TopicExchange and RoutingKey, and you can bind the TopicExchange and RoutingKey to queue. But in Azure Service bus, there is no concept of TopicExchange and RoutingKey, you can directly send message to queue.

3. Don't change the code for other cases. If the code itself needn't be changed according to guideline, simply return false without any additional content.
