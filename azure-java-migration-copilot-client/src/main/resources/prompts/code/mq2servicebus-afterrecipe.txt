You need to rewrite the code to fix the issue using Azure service bus instead of Rabbit MQ with Spring Messaging, change the code following below steps:
1. If the code is a java code, check the code to see if it uses the class in package com.azure.spring.messaging.*
1.1 Check if class com.azure.spring.messaging.servicebus.core.ServiceBusTemplate is used in the java code, If so, fix syntax error according to below sample:
```java
import com.azure.spring.messaging.servicebus.core.ServiceBusTemplate;
import org.springframework.messaging.support.MessageBuilder;
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableAzureMessaging
public class Application {

    private static final String QUEUE_NAME = "<service-bus-queue-name>";

    private final ServiceBusTemplate serviceBusTemplate;

    public void sendMessage(String message) {
        serviceBusTemplate.sendAsync(QUEUE_NAME, MessageBuilder.withPayload(message).build()).subscribe();
    }
}
```
1.2 please keep package statement and don't change the import statement.
1.3 Don't change the code for other cases.

2. If the code is a java code and uses the RabbitMQ with Spring Messaging, rewrite the code using Azure Service Bus with Spring Messaging instead of RabbitMQ with Spring Messaging.
2.1 In rabbit MQ, there is concept of TopicExchange and RoutingKey, and you can bind the TopicExchange and RoutingKey to queue. But in Azure Service bus, there is no concept of TopicExchange and RoutingKey, you can directly send message to queue.

3. If the code itself needn't be changed according to guideline, simply return false without any additional content.
